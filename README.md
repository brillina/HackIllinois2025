## Inspiration
We were inspired by an underwater themeâ€”specifically koi fish ponds since koi fish are symbols of wealth and good fortune. We aimed to create a platform that makes managing money and learning financial literacy more interactive and engaging.

## What it does
Mizu is our Mascot! He will guide you through the website and help you interact with the website to make the most out of it! Mizu is a little koi fish who knows a lot about managing money, he hopes to revolutionize your world with
better money management. Our interactive platform allows users to build financial literacy skills through quizzes and modules. Users can track their progress and build an aquarium of fish as they complete units. 

## How we built it
We built our website using React, HTML, and CSS. We created an outline and overall design for our website with Figma.

## What's next for Mizu
We hope to expand from a website to an app as well! We already created some designs for a Mizu app version through Figma.
